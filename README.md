# PollScript
If not working run:
sudo apt-get install html2text
on linux or
brew install html2text
for mac
addedPolls.sh outputs the average current spread from all available polls, as well as the number of polls the current leader is ahead by. All data is pulled from the Real Clear Politics poll feed.
The output of this will read: 
"The current spread benefits Clinton [+1]
and Clinton is ahead in 107 more polls than Trump, out of 193 total polls."
with variate numbers. 
Currently this is functioning for OSX, and an installation of html2text is required.
